# FaceClassification

In this project two different data sets were combined and used ( www.thispersondoesnotexist.com & https://www.face-rec.org/databases/). 1000 pictures were labeled and fed into three different NN architecture.

1.simple CNN with 3 Conv layers

2.VGG16 with loaded weights

3.InceptionV3

We can see that F1-score and accuracy both increase as we move from simple CSS to more sophisticated models like VGG16 and ultimately InceptionV3 model.
